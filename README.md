# DATA-MANIPULATION-AND-EXTRACTION-USING-SQL
SQL Query Analysis and Troubleshooting


This project is a deep dive into SQL, showcasing my ability to craft complex queries to extract and analyze data from large databases. The analysis includes a series of tasks involving product and work order data, with a focus on creating effective queries, refining data retrieval, and troubleshooting common issues.

Key Tasks and Insights:
Product Overview and Data Extraction:
Extracted data on products from the Product table, including product details like name, size, and color, along with the associated ProductSubcategory and Category names.
Ordered the results by ProductSubcategory and Category to ensure meaningful and structured data output.
Advanced Querying:
Constructed a query to identify the most expensive bikes that are still actively sold, highlighting my ability to filter and sort data based on specific conditions, such as price and sales status.
Work Order Analysis:
Created aggregated queries to analyze work orders from the workorderrouting table, including metrics such as unique work orders, unique products, and total actual cost for January 2004.
Expanded queries by adding location names and calculating the average days between actual start and end dates, adding greater depth to the analysis.
Query Validation and Troubleshooting:
Investigated and corrected queries that were initially providing incorrect results, focusing on understanding where errors occurred and how to fix them.
Provided feedback on how to improve query readability and debug issues efficiently, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
Skills Demonstrated:
SQL Querying: Proficient in SELECT, JOIN, aggregation, and filtering techniques.
Data Analysis: Expertise in extracting valuable insights from large datasets and presenting them in a meaningful way.
Troubleshooting: Analyzed and fixed problematic queries, improving data accuracy and system functionality.
Problem-Solving: Applied critical thinking to ensure data integrity and optimize query performance.
This project highlights my ability to work with complex datasets, refine SQL queries, and solve real-world data problems. It also showcases my understanding of SQL and how I can leverage it to drive insights and solve business problems efficiently.
